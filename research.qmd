## Key Themes

### Invasion Pathways and Risk Assessment

I study how invasive species are introduced and spread, and develop tools for horizon scanning and risk prioritization. This includes examining trade, tourism, and cultural pathways, and advising on management responses.

### iEcology and Culturomics

Using social media, search trends, and Wikipedia data, I analyze public attention to biodiversity issues. These digital signals provide early warnings and insights into societal awareness of species and environmental change.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Digital Conservation Tools

I co-develop methods and open tools to monitor species distributions and detect emerging threats. These tools aim to support policymakers and improve public engagement with science.

### Public Engagement with Biodiversity Loss

My recent work examines how extinction is communicated online and how people respond emotionally to biodiversity loss. I explore how these reactions differ by taxon, geography, and platform.
