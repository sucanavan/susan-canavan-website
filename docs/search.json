This includes examining trade, tourism, and cultural pathways, and advising on management responses.\n\n\n\nUsing social media, search trends, and Wikipedia data, I analyze public attention to biodiversity issues. These digital signals provide early warnings and insights into societal awareness of species and environmental change.\n\n\n\nI co-develop methods and open tools to monitor species distributions and detect emerging threats. These tools aim to support policymakers and improve public engagement with science.\n\n\n\nMy recent work examines how extinction is communicated online and how people respond emotionally to biodiversity loss. I explore how these reactions differ by taxon, geography, and platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHover over nodes for details. Drag to explore."
