    "text": "Key Themes\n\nInvasion Pathways and Risk Assessment\nI study how invasive species are introduced and spread, and develop tools for horizon scanning and risk prioritization. This includes examining trade, tourism, and cultural pathways, and advising on management responses.\n\n\n\niEcology and Culturomics\nUsing social media, search trends, and Wikipedia data, I analyze public attention to biodiversity issues. These digital signals provide early warnings and insights into societal awareness of species and environmental change.\n\n\n\nDigital Conservation Tools\nI co-develop methods and open tools to monitor species distributions and detect emerging threats. These tools aim to support policymakers and improve public engagement with science.\n\n\n\nPublic Engagement with Biodiversity Loss\nMy recent work examines how extinction is communicated online and how people respond emotionally to biodiversity loss. I explore how these reactions differ by taxon, geography, and platform."
